# Doddanna B

### Staff Engineer | Platform Architect | Java Backend Specialist

I’m Doddanna, a Staff Engineer with over 10 years of experience in building scalable backend systems and production-grade distributed architectures. I specialize in crafting reliable microservices with a strong emphasis on clean code, performance, and maintainability. In my career, I’ve taken ownership of 20+ services—from ideation to deployments.

I enjoy working at the intersection of engineering depth and business value—leading teams, mentoring developers, and driving platform evolution with a focus on clarity, resilience, and observability. Whether it’s designing new systems, optimizing existing workflows, or enabling teams to scale with confidence, I bring a grounded, hands-on approach to engineering leadership.

Outside of work, I’m a quiet learner—diving into system design, exploring frameworks, and tinkering with tools that help me improve incrementally every day.
